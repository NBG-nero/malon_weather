Malon Weather is a two paged weather app that displays the city name, country name, current weather conditions and other details of a list of cities on the first page and on user interactions navigates to the second page for more weather details using openweathermap api. While building Malon Weather I couldnt find a way to get a list of cities and their current weather conditions from openweathermap, the other option was a downloaded json file that was out of date, so I generated a list from individual city weather data.
